# 🔍 Multi-Engine Analysis Diagnostic Guide

## Based on Your Screenshot Analysis

From the screenshot you provided, I can see several issues that explain why the multi-engine analysis isn't working:

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**

1. **No Analysis Engines Selected**
   - The system shows "No engines selected" or similar status
   - You need to select WD-EVA02 and/or Janus Pro 7B in Settings

2. **Missing API Keys**  
   - Multi-engine analysis requires a Replicate API key
   - The AI tagging requires an OpenRouter API key

3. **Confusing Model Selection**
   - The "Model" dropdown you see is for legacy LLM analysis
   - The new multi-engine system uses different settings

### ✅ **Immediate Fix Steps:**

#### Step 1: Go to Settings
Click the **Settings** tab at the top of the page

#### Step 2: Add Replicate API Key
1. Find the "Replicate API Key" field
2. Get your key from: https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
3. Enter the key (starts with `r8_...`)
4. Click **Test** to verify

#### Step 3: Select Analysis Engines
Look for "**画像解析エンジン（複数選択可）**" section:
- ☑️ Check **WD EVA02-Large v3** for anime analysis
- ☑️ Check **Janus Pro 7B** for general vision analysis

#### Step 4: Verify Tagging Engine
In "**タグ生成エンジン（１つ選択）**":
- 🔘 Select **DeepSeek** (recommended)

#### Step 5: Return to Image Tab
- Go back to **Image to Prompt** tab
- The status should now show your selected engines
- Upload an image and click **"AI Analysis & Tag Generation"**

### 🔧 **Quick Diagnostic Commands**

If you want to check the current system state, open the browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check current engine selections
console.log('Analysis Engines:', appState.selectedAnalysisEngines);
console.log('Tagging Engine:', appState.selectedTaggingEngine);
console.log('Replicate API Key:', appState.replicateApiKey ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
console.log('OpenRouter API Key:', appState.apiKey ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
```

### 📋 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

1. **Engine Status Indicator**: Should show "WD-EVA02 + Janus Pro 7B → DeepSeek"
2. **AI Generate Button**: Should be enabled when image is uploaded
3. **Analysis Results**: Should appear in colored sections:
   - 🟢 Green section for WD-EVA02 results
   - 🟣 Purple section for Janus Pro 7B results
4. **Tags Generated**: Should appear in the Tag Editor below

### 🚨 **Common Error Messages & Solutions:**

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| "No analysis engines selected" | Go to Settings → Select WD-EVA02 and/or Janus Pro 7B |
| "Replicate API key is required" | Add Replicate API key in Settings |
| "Please upload an image first" | Upload an image via drag-and-drop |
| Analysis results are empty | Check API key, verify engines selected |
| "AI Analysis & Tag Generation failed" | Verify all API keys and try again |

### 🎯 **Your Specific Issue:**

Based on your screenshot showing no analysis results, the most likely cause is:

1. **No analysis engines selected** - You need to go to Settings and check the engine boxes
2. **Missing Replicate API key** - Required for both WD-EVA02 and Janus Pro 7B
3. **Using old UI elements** - The "Model" dropdown is legacy, ignore it

### 📞 **Test After Fix:**

Try this test sequence:
1. ✅ Configure engines in Settings
2. ✅ Upload a test image (anime character recommended for WD-EVA02)  
3. ✅ Click "AI Analysis & Tag Generation"
4. ✅ Wait 30-60 seconds for analysis
5. ✅ Check for colored result sections
6. ✅ Verify tags appear in Tag Editor

### 💡 **Pro Tips:**

- **Start Simple**: Try just Janus Pro 7B first to test the system
- **API Credits**: Ensure your Replicate account has sufficient credits
- **Image Size**: Large images (>2MB) may take longer to process
- **Network**: Ensure stable internet connection for API calls

### 🔗 **Quick Links:**
- Replicate API Keys: https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
- OpenRouter API Keys: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Test both WD-EVA02 and Janus Pro 7B models on Replicate to verify access

**After following these steps, the multi-engine analysis should work correctly and show results similar to the system demonstration.**
